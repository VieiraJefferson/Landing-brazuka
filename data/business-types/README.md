# Business Types Data

This directory contains markdown files with detailed information about each business type that will have dedicated landing pages.

## Structure

Each business type should have its own markdown file with the following structure:

- `business-type-name.md` - Contains all the data for that specific business type

## Data Format

Each markdown file should include:
- Business type name
- Description
- Features
- Benefits
- Use cases
- Screenshots/mockups references
- Any other relevant information

## Implementation Plan

After collecting all business type data, we will:
1. Create individual components for each business type
2. Create dedicated routes/pages for each type
3. Integrate with the main landing page
